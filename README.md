# rejoice-in-the-lambda
A repository to store useful Scheme procedures.

Note: Due to differences between scheme implementations' methods of including files, these files do not act as libraries which provide their respective functionality.  Rather, they should be written to the r7rs standard, and intended to be used as reference materials. Users may replicate their functionality in their implementation of choice.

If you would like to submit a procedure based on a particular implementation whose functionality would be non-trivial to implement in r7rs, please place it in a subdirectory whose dir-name is the name of the implementation,  Also, please annotate the source file regarding which parts of the procedure are specific to the implementation.
